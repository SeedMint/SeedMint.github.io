## Welcome to SeedMint

a place where you find all information for making your own SeedMint and potentially also for buying one in the future.

See the GitHub repository for the Design Data

I'll be working on this site as my understanding grows and I find the time needed to do so.
Feel free to reach out if you can help or need any additional information for making or sourcing a SeedMint yourself.
Also if meanwhile somebody wants to take the design and bring it to market I'll help where I can

Parts to buy: (just paste the description into a search engine to find local sources)
